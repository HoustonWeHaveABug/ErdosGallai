# ErdosGallai

#### Check if a simple graph can be generated using Erdos-Gallai theorem

This program implements the shortened version of the algorithm. It has linear complexity both in time and space.

It expects the number of vertices and the degree of each vertex on the standard input.

It takes 0,05 seconds on my computer to check a valid graph of 100,000 vertices using this program.
